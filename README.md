# SimpleMakefile
An example of a simple makefile that does headers, sources, and puts intermediates and products in sensible, gitignorable locations.

Based on the example at [A Simple Makefile Tutorial](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/) but modified to create the directories for you as needed, and to have the Makefile and sources at the top level. (However, the locations for the various things are configurable)
